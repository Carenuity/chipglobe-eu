                    Dispute resolution<br>
                    The European Commission provides a platform for online dispute resolution
                    (OS): https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr.<br>
                    Please find our email in the impressum/legal notice.<br><br>

                    We do not take part in online dispute resolutions at consumer arbitration boards.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Liability for Contents</strong><br>
                    As service providers, we are liable for own contents of these websites according to
                    Sec. 7, paragraph 1 German Telemedia Act (TMG). However, according to Sec. 8 to
                    10 German Telemedia Act (TMG), service providers are not obligated to
                    permanently monitor submitted or stored information or to search for evidences
                    that indicate illegal activities.<br>

                    Legal obligations to removing information or to blocking the use of information
                    remain unchallenged. In this case, liability is only possible at the time of knowledge
                    about a specific violation of law. Illegal contents will be removed immediately at
                    the time we get knowledge of them.<br>

                    <strong>Liability for Links</strong><br>
                    Our offer includes links to external third party websites. We have no influence on
                    the contents of those websites, therefore we cannot guarantee for those contents.
                    Providers or administrators of linked websites are always responsible for their own
                    contents.<br>

                    The linked websites had been checked for possible violations of law at the time of
                    the establishment of the link. Illegal contents were not detected at the time of the
                    linking. A permanent monitoring of the contents of linked websites cannot be
                    imposed without reasonable indications that there has been a violation of law.
                    Illegal links will be removed immediately at the time we get knowledge of them.<br>

                    <strong>Copyright</strong><br>
