    "description": "ChipGlobe and its entire team embody comprehensive, sophisticated, and future-oriented chip design management. We are determined to find the optimal way for every stakeholder, joining together and transferring the initial idea—and the project as a whole—to realisation. What distinguishes us is the way in which we understand and embody chip design management. In a highly technologized environment characterized by clarity and logic, the human factor is the greatest challenge we face. We're aware of that, and our wealth of experience means we're familiar with sudden or unexpected events which—despite your best endeavors—can present seemingly intractable problems.",
